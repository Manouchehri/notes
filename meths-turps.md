# Key points of various types of solvents and alcohols

Methylated "spirit"

* 95% ethanol and 5% methanol with a dye to colour it.
* almost pure alcohol with stuff added to deter human consumption
* you don't have to pay taxes for transporting alcohol since you can't drink it.
* also known as "denatured alcohol"
* dye can be pyridine
* purpose of dye is to stop it tasting OK if you drink it
* technically no such thing as a "methylated" spirit - the common usage of the name is more "spirits (ethanol) cut with methanol to get around tax stuff"
* The methanol does not change the chemical properties of the ethanol and is nearly impossible to remove.
* Pure ethanol is very valuable and for economic reasons the government treats it like currency. The addition of methanol makes "denatured" alcohol impossible to "counterfiet".
* Uses
    * solvent for paint

Surgical spirit

* Same as Methylated spirit but no dye

Mineral turpentine/Turps

* a fluid obtained by the distillation of resin obtained from live trees, mainly pines - composed of terpenes
* contains "turpenes"
* does not contain any alcohol
* Uses
    * cleaning brushes
    * thinning pigments

Isopropyl alcohol/Rubbing alcohol

* some "rubbing alcohol is just ethanol mixed with water"
* toxic to drink, harmless applied to skin
* usually about 65% isopropanol, 35% water, (also undrinkable.)
* Massage. Others are not used because:
    * methanol is poisonous and can be absorbed through skin
    * Ethanol is very expensive

White Spirit/Mineral spirit/Paint thinner

* a petroleum-derived mixture of aliphatic and alicyclic C7 to C12 hydrocarbons with a maximum content of 25% of C7 to C12 aromatic hydrocarbons.
* A typical composition for mineral spirits is > 65% C10 or higher hydrocarbons,[6] aliphatic solvent hexane, and a maximum benzene content of 0.1% by volume.
* basically distilled refined kerosene.
* designed as a a cheap substitute for Turpentine (turpentine has better solvent power, is more environmentally friendly)

Acetone

* Uses
    * Solvent for nail polish

# Solvent

* Something which dissolves some other substance resulting in a "solution"
* e.g. turpentine will dissolve paint resulting in a substance which is an evenly mixture of paint+turpentine (called the solution)
