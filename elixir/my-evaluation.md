Things I like

* doc strings in functions


* -- no obvious way to uninstall an archive
* -- no obvious way to update an archive. it seems you just install a new version and it overwrites it


On haml

* converting haml from ruby land to elixir land, the fact that '' is anot a real string in elixir requires a bit of work
* by default the rendered html is in one big line - not as nice to read in dev tools
* seems to not evaluate function calls in interpolated strings



No new relic, no raygun client :-(
