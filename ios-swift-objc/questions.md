What is the idiomatic way to create global debugging functions e.g. `DLog`?
    some folks say precompiled headers are bad practice - why?

What do `typedef` and `enum` do in ObjC

How do I set multiple values in an enum?

I think it is

[rec doThing:thing withOptions:NSFoo | NSBar | NSBblah

but am not sure
