# My learning notes

_These are quite likely incomplete and sometimes incorrect_. They are after all
topics that I am still learning. YMMV.

# How I think about learning

* Commit to finishing a chapter, not a book. I should remain nimble about the
  depth I learn a particular topic. To commit to a whole book lets the author
  decide on the depth that might not be a good investment of time for me.

* Organise notes by topic, not by source. Notes are for
    1. Revising what I have learned
    2. Express what I have learned to help me find holes in my understanding
  Notes organised by topic are more suitable for these goals - I may keep track
  of which resources I have finished separately.
* It's ok for notes to be messy/wrong. Building them up is an iterative process
  and there is as much value in re-reading and improving them as creating the
  initial draft.
* Do a _breadth first_ traversal. When learning from a source, just mark any
* questions/todos that come up - don't follow them too much because
        1. It is not always clear how much depth I need to go in a topic
        2. I would never get anything finished
