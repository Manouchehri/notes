# WCAG
A set of guidelines for makeing content accessible, primarily for disabled users but also for limited devices like phones
* priority 1 = **must** satisfy these requirements
* priority 2 = should satisfy these requirements
* priority 3 = **may** satistfy these requirements
version 2.0 released in 2008

The US government has a similar set of standards in Section 508 (partly based on WCAG 1.0)
7% of us populaciton are colorblind approx 1 in 14

3 options for dealing with this
1. when conveying information don't use color alone (best option)
2. don't use problematic colors side-by-side (use photoshop plugin to check)
3. daltonize the content (extreme measure)


## Web accessibility
 RAISING MY GAME
	learn to use NVDA competently and add it to my x-browser testing

	put together a list of best practices for not fucking up accessability on a site
		consider contrast changing stylesheets - should I group my color styles together?
		make sure keyboard nav works on my sites
		what happens if JS changes content on a site? can screen readers handle it?
		supply redundant text links for screen readers that don't support image maps
		Colors are unusable	Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning
		Users expect links to take them somewhere	Don't write scripts in links that don't have true destinations associated with them (e.g. href="javascript: function(this)")
	QUESTIONS
		what screen readers to nz blind use?
