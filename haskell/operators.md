## Operators

```haskell
-- infix operator examples
x ^ a -- where a is an integer
x ** a -- where a is any number type
x % y -- get ratio between two number. x, y must be of same type
```

* lets you make new operators (which are just binary functions)
* operators can be applied like normal functions by wrapping them in `()`
*

```haskell
(+) 3 4 -- 7
```
