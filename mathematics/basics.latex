\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Calculus

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    the study of change
  \item
    to do with relationships between quantities
  \item
    Two major branches

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
    \item
      Differential calculus - the study of rates of change and slopes of
      curves
    \item
      Integral calculus - the study of areas under and between curves
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    The two branches are related using the \emph{fundemental theory of
    calculus}
  \item
    A calculus refers to any system of calculation guided by the
    symbolic manipulation of expressions e.g.~lambda calculus
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Algebra

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    the study of operations and how they can be applied to solve
    equations
  \item
    from an arabic word meaning the \emph{reunion of broken parts}
  \item
    the study of symbols and the rules for manipulating symbols
  \item
    a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics
  \item
    2 forms: \emph{Elementary} and \emph{Advanced}

    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
    \item
      Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of
      abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are
      either unknown or allowed to take on many values
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Can also be a specialized kind of \emph{mathematical object} e.g.
    \emph{linear algebra}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Geometry

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    the study of shape
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Arithmetic

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    The study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional
    operations between them --- addition, subtraction, multiplication
    and division.
  \item
    A part of \emph{number theory} - until the 19th century they were
    pretty much the same thing.
  \item
    The oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics - origins
    around 2000 BCE ish.
  \item
    Any \emph{set} of objects on which \emph{all four} of the basic
    operations can be performed is called a \textbf{field} i.e.~if you
    can add, subtract, multiply, divide these objects and they follow
    the normal rules then they are a \emph{field}.
  \item
    each \emph{field} has some special elements:

    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
    \item
      identity element

      \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
      \item
        the element which when operated on with any other element
        returns the other element
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      inverse element

      \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
      \item
        the element which when operated on with a particular element
        returns the identity element
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    4 basic operations:

    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
    \item
      addition

      \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
      \item
        commutative and associative
      \item
        identity element is 0
      \item
        inverse element of A is -A
      \item
        can be performed using geometry using sticks!
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      subtraction

      \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
      \item
        the inverse of addition
      \item
        not commutative, not associative
      \item
        because it is less convenient when things are not commutative
        and associative you can think of \(a - b\) as \(a + (-b)\)
        instead.
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      multiplication

      \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
      \item
        the second basic operation of arithmetic
      \item
        is commutative and associative
      \item
        distributive over addition and subtraction - ???
      \item
        identity element is 1
      \item
        inverse element of an element is its reciprocal i.e.
        \(x * (1/x) = 1\)
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      division

      \begin{itemize}
      \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
      \item
        the inverse of multiplication
      \item
        anything divided by 0 is not defined
      \item
        not commutative, not associative
      \item
        because it is less convenient when things are not commutative
        and associative you can think of \(a/b\) as \(a * (1/b)\)
        instead.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    note that addition and multiplication are the real \emph{basic}
    operations - subtraction and division are just their inverses.
  \item
    Also are other more advanced operations:

    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
    \item
      percentages
    \item
      square roots
    \item
      exponentiation
    \item
      logarithms
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Aside: without the concept of 0 our positional number scheme would not
be possible!

\section{Functions}\label{functions}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  functions can be written in english or more succicently using
  mathemtatical symbols
\item
  functions are the same iff they produce the same output for the same
  input
\item
  it does not matter how they ``look'' i.e.~they don't have to have the
  same ``rule'' or the same ``way of turning the input into the output''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Important functions}\label{important-functions}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  \(f(x) = x\) the identity function
\item
  \(f(x) = c\) the constant function
\item
  \(f(x) = ax + b\)
\item
  \(f(x) = x^n\)
\item
  \(f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x + 1\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    a cubic \emph{polynomial}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(f(x) = \sqrt{x}\)
\item
  \(f(x) = |x|\)
\item
  \(f(x) = sin(x)\) (transcendental)
\item
  \(f(x) = cos(x)\) (transcendental)
\item
  \(f(x) = tan(x)\) (transcendental)
\end{itemize}

Functions can be \emph{composed} into a sort of conveyor belt that pipes
the output of one function into the input of another e.g. \(f(g(x))\) or
\(f \circ g\).

\subsection{Polynomials}\label{polynomials}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and
  coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition,
  subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{tancendental functions}\label{tancendental-functions}

\begin{quote}
A transcendental function is an analytic function that does not satisfy
a polynomial equation, in contrast to an algebraic function. (The
polynomials are sometimes required to have rational coefficients.) In
other words, a transcendental function ``transcends'' algebra in that it
cannot be expressed in terms of a finite sequence of the algebraic
operations of addition, multiplication, and root extraction. Examples of
transcendental functions include the exponential function, the
logarithm, and the trigonometric functions.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Defn: domain of a
function}\label{defn-domain-of-a-function}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The set of input values can I put into a function and get a
  \emph{valid} output
\item
  Note: it is a \emph{set} of values
\item
  Example: for \(f(x) = x^2\) the domain is \(\{ x \in \mathbb{R}\}\) or
  \emph{x is contained in the real numbers}
\item
  Examples:

  \begin{itemize}
  \itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
  \item
    for \(f(x) = \sqrt{x}\) the domain is \(\{x \in [ -1, \infty ) \}\)
  \item
    for \(f(x) = 1/\sqrt{x}\) the domain is
    \(\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x \neq 0 \}\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Defn: range of a
function}\label{defn-range-of-a-function}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The \emph{set} of all possible values the output of a function can
  take on given all possible inputs
\end{itemize}

\section{Square root function}\label{square-root-function}

The square root function takes a number an spits out some outputs. When
you multiply that new number by itself you get back the original number.

There are two possible outputs of this function for any given number -
the positive and negative roots. This means that the function could do
two different things and still be ``correct'' and we can't say for sure
which should happen. This is an ambiguity - it maps one input value to
two possible output values.

In code we could probably have this thing just return an array of the
possible answers but mathematics is not comfortable with that becasue
???.

\begin{verbatim}
QUESTION: Why is it a bad thing for a function to retrun an array of
answers in math? (Sun 26 Apr 12:34:18 2015)
\end{verbatim}

Math really wants a function that takes \emph{one} number and returns
\emph{one} number so we \emph{define} the square root function to be

\begin{quote}
The \emph{non negative} number which squares to x
\end{quote}

This means that by convention we always pick the positive root. A
somewhat surprising consequence of defining the square root function in
this way is that

\(\sqrt{x^2} \neq x\)

but we \textbf{can} say that

\(\sqrt{x^2} = |x|\)

The domain of \(\sqrt{}\) is \(\{ x \in [0, \infty) \}\)

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  the domain here is described here using an \emph{interval}
\item
  The {[} means to include the 0
\item
  the ) means to exclude the \(\infty\) (because infinity is not a
  number)
\end{itemize}

Aside: Infinity (\(\infty\)) is not a number

\begin{verbatim}
# wolfram alpha command
plot sqrt(x), x=-10 to 10

# a quad root
(1 - x^4)^(1/4) >= 0
\end{verbatim}

\section{Cube and quad root
functions}\label{cube-and-quad-root-functions}
