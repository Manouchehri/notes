# Branches of math

* Calculus
    * the study of change
    * to do with relationships between quantities
    * Two major branches
        1. Differential calculus - the study of rates of change and slopes of curves
        2. Integral calculus - the study of areas under and between curves
    * The two branches are related using the _fundemental theory of calculus_
    * A calculus refers to any system of calculation guided by the symbolic
      manipulation of expressions e.g. lambda calculus
* Algebra
    * the study of operations and how they can be applied to solve equations
    * from an arabic word meaning the _reunion of broken parts_
    * the study of symbols and the rules for manipulating symbols
    * a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics
    * 2 forms: _Elementary_ and _Advanced_
        * Elementary algebra differs from arithmetic in the use of
          abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are
          either unknown or allowed to take on many values
    * Can also be a specialized kind of _mathematical object_ e.g. _linear algebra_
* Geometry
    * the study of shape
* Arithmetic
    * The study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional
      operations between them â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication and
      division.
    * A part of _number theory_ - until the 19th century they were pretty much
      the same thing.
    * The oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics - origins around
      2000 BCE ish.
    * Any _set_ of objects on which _all four_ of the basic operations can be
      performed is called a **field** i.e. if you can add, subtract, multiply,
      divide these objects and they follow the normal rules then they are a
      _field_.
    * each _field_ has some special elements:
        * identity element
            * the element which when operated on with any other element returns
              the other element
        * inverse element
            * the element which when operated on with a particular element
              returns the identity element
    * 4 basic operations:
        * addition
            * commutative and associative
            * identity element is 0
            * inverse element of A is -A
            * can be performed using geometry using sticks!
        * subtraction
            * the inverse of addition
            * not commutative, not associative
            * because it is less convenient when things are not commutative and
              associative you can think of $a - b$ as $a + (-b)$ instead.
        * multiplication
            * the second basic operation of arithmetic
            * is commutative and associative
            * distributive over addition and subtraction - ???
            * identity element is 1
            * inverse element of an element is its reciprocal i.e. $x * (1/x) = 1$
        * division
            * the inverse of multiplication
            * anything divided by 0 is not defined
            * not commutative, not associative
            * because it is less convenient when things are not commutative and
            associative you can think of $a/b$ as $a * (1/b)$ instead.
    * note that addition and multiplication are the real _basic_ operations -
      subtraction and division are just their inverses.
    * Also are other more advanced operations:
        * percentages
        * square roots
        * exponentiation
        * logarithms

Aside: without the concept of 0 our positional number scheme would not be possible!

### Top level divisions of modern mathematics

1. Algebra
2. Geometry
3. Analysis
4. Number theory
    * arithmetic is in this division

# Numbers WIP

The heirarchy of groups of numbers:

* Real numbers $\mathbb{R}$
    * includes
        * transcendental numbers
        * irrational numbers
        * fractions
* Complex numbers
* Imaginary numbers
* Natural numbers
* Rational numbers
* Irrational numbers
* Transcendental numbers


# Functions

* functions can be written in english or more succicently using mathemtatical
  symbols
* functions are the same iff they produce the same output for the same input
* it does not matter how they "look" i.e. they don't have to have the same
  "rule" or the same "way of turning the input into the output"

## Important functions

* $f(x) = x$ the identity function
* $f(x) = c$ the constant function
* $f(x) = ax + b$
* $f(x) = x^n$
* $f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x + 1$
    * a cubic _polynomial_
* $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$
* $f(x) = |x|$
* $f(x) = sin(x)$ (transcendental)
* $f(x) = cos(x)$ (transcendental)
* $f(x) = tan(x)$ (transcendental)

Functions can be _composed_ into a sort of conveyor belt that pipes the output
of one function into the input of another e.g. $f(g(x))$ or $f \circ g$.

## Polynomials

* a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, that
  involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
  non-negative integer exponents.
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial

## tancendental functions

> A transcendental function is an analytic function that does not satisfy a
> polynomial equation, in contrast to an algebraic function. (The polynomials
> are sometimes required to have rational coefficients.) In other words, a
> transcendental function "transcends" algebra in that it cannot be expressed
> in terms of a finite sequence of the algebraic operations of addition,
> multiplication, and root extraction.  Examples of transcendental functions
> include the exponential function, the logarithm, and the trigonometric
> functions.

### Defn: domain of a function

* The set of input values can I put into a function and get a _valid_ output
* Note: it is a _set_ of values
* Example: for $f(x) = x^2$ the domain is $\{ x \in \mathbb{R}\}$ or _x is
  contained in the real numbers_
* Examples:
    * for $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ the domain is $\{x \in [ -1, \infty ) \}$
    * for $f(x) = 1/\sqrt{x}$ the domain is $\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x \neq 0 \}$

### Defn: range of a function

* The _set_ of all possible values the output of a function can take on given all possible inputs

# Square root

The square root function takes a number an spits out a new number. When you
multiply that new number by itself you get back the original number.

There are two possible outputs of this function for any given number - the
positive and negative roots. This means that the function could do two
different things and still be "correct" and we can't say for sure which should
happen.

The problem is not tow inputs producing the same out put, it is two outputs for the same input

This is an ambiguity - it maps one input value to two possible output values.
In code we could probably have this thing just return an array of the possible
answers but mathematics is not comfortable with that becasue ???

Math realy wants a function that takes _one_ number and returns _one_ number so
we _define_ the square root function to be

> The _non negative_ number which squares to x

This means that by convention we always pick the positive root. We can also
have the "complete and accurate square root function" that returns two values
but this is not the common usage.

A somewhat surprising consequence of defining the square root function in this
way is that

$\sqrt{x^2} \neq x$

but we **can** say that

$\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$

The domain of $\sqrt{}$ is $\{ x \in [0, \infty) \}$

* the domain is described here using an _interval_
* The [ means to include the 0
* the ) means to exclude the $\infty$ (because infinity is not a number)

Aside: Infinity ($\infty$) is not a number
