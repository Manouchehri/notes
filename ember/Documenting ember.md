Documenting ember

* show signature of hooks
* show how to get reference to other things in the system
Route
  beforeModel
    model // you can't


  model
  afterModel


  Diagram ideas

  flow of control through objects as you change url


  dependency graph (or who has refernces to what)
    e.g. template function gets a ref to the controller, not the view ???
  split the graphs up into smaller chunks e.g. view+template+controller
