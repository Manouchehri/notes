# What are the advantages of using an addon vs pulling stuff in directly yourself?

++ convenience - bit like gems in rails land
++ it is basically just a curated set of npm packages that you know will work and have some of the integration work done for you e.g. pulling in 'moment' direclty from npm vs pulling in 'ember-cli-moment'

-- in many cases they don't seem to do a great deal
-- I don't understand what they are doing so makes me not trust them fully
++ they do provide a good reference for what to do - it is worth learning how they do it so we can streamline pulling in packages

Conclusion: the main barrier to using it is that I don't know what they are doing
